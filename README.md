# SAAS Consent Adviser
This application was commisioned by the South Australian Ambulance Service to be developed by Flinders University law students. The application is meant to assist paramedics in navigating medical consent law to ensure that they know who to get medical consent from, and when they can administer medical treatment without consent.
